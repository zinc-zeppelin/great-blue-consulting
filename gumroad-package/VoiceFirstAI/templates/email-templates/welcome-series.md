## Email 2: Day 3 Follow-up

**Subject:** Quick question about {Company}'s automation plans

**Template:**
```html
<p>Hi {Name},</p>

<p>I wanted to follow up on the AI automation opportunities we discussed for {Company}.</p>

<p>Many businesses struggle with taking the first step because they're not sure where to start. That's completely normal!</p>

<p>Here's what I typically recommend:</p>

<p><strong>Start Small, Win Big</strong><br>
Pick ONE process that's eating up 2+ hours of your week. We'll automate that first, prove the ROI, then expand from there.</p>

<p>For {Company}, I'd suggest starting with: [Specific recommendation based on their consultation]</p>

<p>This alone could save you [X hours] per week.</p>

<p>Still interested? Here's my calendar: {CalendarLink}</p>

<p>No pressure - just wanted to make sure you had a clear path forward if you decide to move ahead.</p>

<p>Best,<br>
