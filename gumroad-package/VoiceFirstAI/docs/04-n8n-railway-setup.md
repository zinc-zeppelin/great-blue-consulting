## Testing Your Setup

1. Activate the workflow in n8n (toggle the Active switch)
2. Go to your website and have a test conversation
3. Fill out the form
4. Check n8n's execution history
5. Verify email was sent

## Railway Pricing

- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month (usually enough for testing)
- **Hobby tier**: $5/month (includes $5 usage)
- **Pro tier**: $20/month (for production use)

For most users, the Hobby tier is perfect for running n8n with moderate usage.

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving data
- Ensure workflow is activated (not just saved)
- Check the webhook URL matches exactly
- Verify no typos in environment variable

### Emails not sending
- Check Gmail app password is correct
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail
- Try with port 465 if 587 doesn't work

### Railway app sleeping
- Free tier apps sleep after inactivity
- Upgrade to Hobby tier to prevent sleeping
- Or ping your webhook every 30 minutes

## Alternative: Self-Hosted n8n

If you prefer to self-host:
1. Use Docker: `docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n`
2. Use npm: `npx n8n`
3. Follow n8n's self-hosting guide

But Railway is recommended for simplicity!
