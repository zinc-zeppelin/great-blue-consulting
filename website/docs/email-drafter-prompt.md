## Writing Guidelines

- **Tone**: Professional but approachable, like a trusted advisor
- **Length**: Keep total email under 400 words
- **Personalization**: Use at least 3 specific details from their conversation
- **Value Focus**: Every paragraph should communicate clear value
- **Avoid**: Generic advice, technical jargon without explanation, overwhelming options

## Example Phrases to Use
- "During our conversation, you mentioned..."
- "Based on your current volume of [X]..."
- "For a business like yours in [industry]..."
- "This could reduce your [specific task] time by..."
- "Other [industry] businesses have seen..."

## Example Phrases to Avoid
- "AI can transform your business" (too generic)
- "You should implement AI" (too prescriptive)
- "Call us to learn more" (too salesy)
- Generic benefits without specific context

## Special Instructions
- If they mentioned competitors, reference how AI can give competitive advantage
- If they expressed skepticism, address it with specific, realistic examples
- If they're technical, include more implementation details
- If they're non-technical, focus on business outcomes
- Always include a "start small" option to reduce perceived risk

Remember: The goal is to make them think "This person really understood my business and has practical ideas I can implement." Every email should feel like a natural continuation of the conversation, not a generic sales pitch.
