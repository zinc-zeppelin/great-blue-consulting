## Alternative: Gmail SMTP Setup

If OAuth2 doesn't work, use SMTP:

1. In n8n, use "Email Send" node instead of Gmail
2. Configure SMTP:
   - **Host**: smtp.gmail.com
   - **Port**: 587
   - **User**: your-email@gmail.com
   - **Password**: Your 16-character app password
   - **SSL/TLS**: Enable "Start TLS"

## Troubleshooting

### "Less secure app access" Error
- Use App Password (not your regular password)
- Make sure 2FA is enabled

### Emails Going to Spam
- Add SPF record to your domain
- Use consistent "from" name
- Avoid spam trigger words

### Gmail Limits
- Free: 500 emails/day
- More than enough for consultations!

### Test Email Not Received
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify workflow is active
3. Check n8n execution logs
4. Ensure webhook URL matches in netlify.toml
